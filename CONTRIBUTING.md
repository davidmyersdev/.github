# Contributing

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to learn how to make a contribution to [one of my projects](https://github.com/davidmyersdev)!

If you have not read it yet, please read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/davidmyersdev/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). These guidelines ensure both maintainers and contributors work together in a respectful, inclusive way. Maintainers have a limited amount of time devoted to many projects, so we ask contributors to be considerate. In return, maintainers will reciprocate that respect and will consider, discuss, and support all acceptable contributions as appropriately identified in this document.

## Contributions

To give you an idea of which contributions are accepted or rejected, here are some examples of acceptable and unacceptable contributions.

### Acceptable Contributions

- When you encounter an unexpected problem, open an Issue with [a minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example).
- Comment on Issues, Discussions, or Pull Requests to provide constructive feedback or (functional) examples.
- Start a Discussion about a new feature idea.
- Write or record an unofficial tutorial about how to use or contribute to [one of my projects](https://github.com/davidmyersdev).
- Submit a Pull Request that resolves an existing Issue.
- Submit a Pull Request that adds to the existing documentation.

### Unacceptable Contributions

- Please **do not** open an Issue for support questions. Use a Discussion instead.
- Please **do not** submit a Pull Request for an undocumented feature idea. All feature ideas should start as Discussions to ensure we have the chance to properly talk about and vet the ideas.
- Please **do not** submit a Pull Request purely for code quality (linting, refactoring, reorganizing, etc).
- Please **do not** comment on an Issue, Discussion, or Pull Request to engage in arguments or promote harassment. See our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/davidmyersdev/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Please **do not** disclose security vulnerabilities in public. Send an email to [david@voracious.dev](mailto:david@voracious.dev) instead.
